#  C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO PROJECT

## The Monty language:

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.


## Monty bytes code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument


## Objectives:

- Know what do LIFO and FIFO mean
- Know what is a stack, and when to use it
- Know what is a queue, and when to use it
- Know what are the common implementations of stacks and queues
- Know what are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- Know what is the proper way to use global variables


## Compilation & Output:

- These codes were compiled using: ```$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty```
- Any output must be printed on ```stdout```
- Any error message must be printed on ```stderr```
